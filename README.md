#RapidSearch
Visual Studio plugin to improve searching speeds

This is a much faster way of searching through large code bases, it utilises different optimisation techniques such as pre-loading the solution contents and selectng the fastest searching algorithm for the situation.

Testing has showed this to decrease search times by 80% on a very large project (241mb).

Feel free to contribute.

This is submitted as my final year project.
