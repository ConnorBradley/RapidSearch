# RapidSearch
Visual Studio plugin to improve searching speeds

This is submitted as my final year project.

Ideally this will be a much faster way of searching through code, techniques such as Boyer-Moore searching, indexing etc... will be looked at.

#Current Issues:
- UML Diagrams

- Unit tests

- Format the directory names in the results tab to just include the file name.

- Record how long a file takes to search using the default Visual Studio plugin data by videoing the process

- Memory Management - possible solution to analyse file by file, or line by line rather than getting the whole solution in one chunk.

- Poor UI

- No way of getting an accurate timing of the default searching system

- ALgorithm is far from efficient yet

- No Boyer-Moore implementation

- Polish the product and then write the repo
